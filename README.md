# Jenkins Assignment - CC lab 08

Welcome to your jenkins assignment! This simple exercise is designed to introduce you to Jenkins and continuous integration.

## Introduction to Jenkins

Jenkins is an open-source, Java-based automation tool. This tool automates the software integration and delivery process called Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery (CI/CD). Jenkins supports various source code management, build, and delivery tools. It provides features like Jenkins Pipelines, which make the delivery process very easy and help teams to adopt DevOps practices seamlessly.

## Overview of the Experiment

1. **Setup Jenkins Using Docker**: Learn how to set up Jenkins in a Docker container.
2. **Set up a Job in Jenkins**: Connect Jenkins to your repository and build a C++ program (`hello.cpp`).
3. **Run the Program**: Set up a second job to run the program after the build completes.
4. **Add a Webhook Trigger**: Automate the execution of jobs in Jenkins by adding a webhook trigger to your GitHub repository.
5. **Create a Basic Jenkins Pipeline**: Understand the basics of Jenkins pipelines.

## Prerequisites

- **Docker**: Installed on your system. (Setup and Installation should have been covered in your previous lab ).
- **Git**: Installed on your system and a GitHub account. Follow this [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2j7fD92g-gE) to install and familiarize yourself with Git.

Create a GitHub repository with the name as `YOUR_SRN_Jenkins`.
